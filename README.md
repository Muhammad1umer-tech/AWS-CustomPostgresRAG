# Custom RAG Deployment with AWS Services

## Project Overview

This project showcases the deployment of a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using AWS cloud infrastructure. It integrates a React-based frontend with a FastAPI backend while using AWS services such as S3, RDS, EC2, VPC, IAM, cloudMap and API Gateway for scalability, security, and performance.

## AWS Architecture

### Key Components:

- **Frontend & Backend**: 
  - Developed using React to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
  - Built with FastAPI to handle API requests and communicate with the database.
  - Implements LangChain and custom RAG for processing CSV data.

- **AWS Services**:
  - **S3**: Used to store CSV files. IAM policies are configured with **read-only** access for security.
  - **RDS**: PostgreSQL database used to store vector embeddings and information extracted from the CSV files.
  - **EC2**: Hosts two servicesâ€”frontend and backend.
  - **VPC**: Designed a custom network with public and private subnet for security.
  - **APIGateaway**: Configured to ensure backend is only accessible internally, not via browser or internet.
  - **Cloud Map**: Utilized for service discovery within the VPC.

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Custom VPC
- **Public Subnet**: 
  - Hosts the EC2 instance for the frontend and backend services.
- **Two Private Subnets**: 
  - Host the RDS instance and fast availability.

### 2. Network Configuration
- **Public Subnet**:
  - Internet Gateway attached to enable internet access.
- **Private Subnets**:
  - NAT Gateway configured to allow one-way communication from the private subnet (RDS) to the internet for necessary updates.

### 3. Security Rules
- **Inbound Rules**:
  - Port `3000` accessible via the internet for the frontend.
  - Port `8000` not directly accessible from the internet.

- **API Gateway**:
  - Used to securely route frontend requests to the backend.
  - Configured with a private API to allow internal access to port `8000` through the API Gateway, ensuring secure communication.

### 4. EC2 & RDS
  - Hosts both frontend and backend services for seamless integration.
  - RDS: Stores PostgreSQL data including vector embeddings and extracted information.
  - RDS is placed in a private subnet with secure access, while EC2 uses a public subnet with controlled inbound rules.

## Features

1. **Custom RAG Implementation**:
   - Processes CSV data which is stored on AWS S3, to generate embeddings stored in PostgreSQL using LangChain.

2. **Secure and Scalable Deployment**:
   - IAM policy with read-only S3 access ensures minimal privileges.
   - Use of private subnets and NAT Gateway to isolate sensitive RDS resources.

3. **Optimized Networking**:
   - API Gateway ensures secure routing and restricts direct public access to backend services.
